# Minimum-Window-Substring-Hard-in-java
ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement

Given two strings s and t, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window.
If no such substring exists, return "".


---

ðŸ”¹ Example

Input:  s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"

Why?

"BANC" is the smallest substring of s that contains "A", "B", and "C".

ðŸ”¹ Intuition (Sliding Window)

We use the sliding window technique with two pointers:

Expand the right pointer until the window contains all characters of t.

Then move the left pointer to shrink the window while itâ€™s still valid.

Keep track of the smallest valid window seen so far.


We use a hashmap (or array) to store:

need: frequency of characters required from t

window: frequency of characters inside the current window of s

ðŸ”¹ Complexity

Time: O(|s| + |t|) â†’ each character is processed at most twice.

Space: O(|s| + |t|) â†’ hashmap storage.
